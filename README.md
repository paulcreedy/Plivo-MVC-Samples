# Plivo-MVC-Samples
Plivo Samples using MVC and .NET Framework 4.0.
Created with Visual Studio Community Edition 2015, but can be edited from Version 2012 onwards.

Released under the MIT license.

The MVC samples for Plivo is written by Paul Creedy as a sandard implementation of using the Plivo API/XML service through the .NET MVC Framework. The essence of this version is to make the sample code as easy to use and reusable as possible, without having to first strip out unnecessary external dependencies.

This project should be considered under development/work in progress.
